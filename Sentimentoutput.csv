Dear Madam


I recently applied for a loan with the abovereferenced bank and was denied credit because give the reason why the bank told you your application was denied I have attached a copy of the written notification the bank gave me for denying my credit application


I believe that the true reason this bank denied me credit was based on my sex or race or marital status and that this bank has violated my rights under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act I believe this to be the case for the following reasons


 My income is sufficient to qualify for the loan

 My debttoincome ratio is within an acceptable range

 I have excellent credit My credit score is 

 The loan officer asked me several inappropriate questions about how many children I plan to have and if I plan to get married soon

 I have firsthand knowledge that males or whites or Anglos or white males or married women that have a similar credit profile to mine have been approved for the same type of financing at this bank

I was informed by the staff that I will be getting the debit card kit withindays but I didnt receive any thing Finally I gave a call to your customer care department and there again I faced problems giving all the details and finally the person informed me that it will take another twentyfive days So I waited again but I didnt receive anything I finally decided to meet the supervisor and he told me to fill in a fresh form as there had been a confusion
I had been a customer of same bank from pastyears in another city and I opened an new account here as the transfer procedure were very long but now I feel I should have done the same It is really disappointing that the banks take so long to give a debit card I request you to look into the matter and have debit card issued soon

The result of this banking error was my name being sent to collections and after all was settled it cost me aroundThat was my cost It brings me great personal satisfaction to write this letter to you and announce what I estimate the current cost of your practices has been to you thus far It has been my goal over the last few years to ensure that all persons in my social network are aware of just how awful you treat your customers Im happy to announce that since this occurrence Ive successfully persuadedpeople to leave bankothers to refinance home mortgages with other institutions and preventedpeople from either switching to your bank or opening an account with you simply by truthfully going over what occurred in my experience with you

I recently applied for a loan with the abovereferenced bank and was denied credit because give the reason why the bank told you your application was denied I have attached a copy of the written notification the bank gave me for denying my credit application


I believe that the true reason this bank denied me credit was based on my sex or race or marital status and that this bank has violated my rights under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act I believe this to be the case for the following reasons


 My income is sufficient to qualify for the loan

 My debttoincome ratio is within an acceptable range

 I have excellent credit My credit score is 

 The loan officer asked me several inappropriate questions about how many children I plan to have and if I plan to get married soon

 I have firsthand knowledge that males or whites or Anglos or white males or married women that have a similar credit profile to mine have been approved for the same type of financing at this bank

When I feel that she is angry with something and not talking to me very well I politely asked her if I have done something wrong and she again rudely treated me and not only that but when I asked her to be polite she intentionally kept me waiting beside the desk while meeting with other customers 
I hope you will take notice of this misfortune and asked that lady what the original problem was and if I had offended her in some way or something else I hope you will take care of this matter and I wont have to face the same problem again or I will consider my other options including leaving the bank and closing my accounts

I believe that the true reason this bank denied me credit was based on my sex or race or marital status and that this bank has violated my rights under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act I believe this to be the case for the following reasons


 My income is sufficient to qualify for the loan

 I have excellent credit My credit score is 

 The loan officer asked me several inappropriate questions about how many children I plan to have and if I plan to get married soon

I recently applied for a loan with the abovereferenced bank and was denied credit because give the reason why the bank told you your application was denied I have attached a copy of the written notification the bank gave me for denying my credit application


I believe that the true reason this bank denied me credit was based on my sex or race or marital status and that this bank has violated my rights under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act I believe this to be the case for the following reasons


 My income is sufficient to qualify for the loan

 My debttoincome ratio is within an acceptable range

 I have excellent credit My credit score is 

 The loan officer asked me several inappropriate questions about how many children I plan to have and if I plan to get married soon

My name is Justin if you look at your records you will notice I used to be a customer of yours I dare say for a few years I was a very happy customer of yours That was until a few years ago when after a string of banking errors and a couple of mistakes on my part forced me to discontinue our previously wellestablished relationship
This was due to a number of factors but primarily the unwillingness of your company to correct what were bank errors due to one of your managers notes I opened my account with you when I waswhen I wasI had two overdraft charges that were reversed they were mistakes on my part One of your managers though put a note on my account stating that no more overdraft charges were to be reversed This became an issue when a number of years later a banking error causedoverdraft charges to occur on a single day I appealed as high as the regional manager but was told nothing could be done The total overdrawn was less thanbut resulted inin overdraft charges I refused to pay and for good reason as my deposit slip clearly showed which account my deposit was supposed to go in ie the account it DID NOT go into and was subsequently overdrawn I wonder now if youll see this as big of a mistake as I did at the time
The result of this banking error was my name being sent to collections and after all was settled it cost me aroundThat was my cost It brings me great personal satisfaction to write this letter to you and announce what I estimate the current cost of your practices has been to you thus far It has been my goal over the last few years to ensure that all persons in my social network are aware of just how awful you treat your customers Im happy to announce that since this occurrence Ive successfully persuadedpeople to leave bankothers to refinance home mortgages with other institutions and preventedpeople from either switching to your bank or opening an account with you simply by truthfully going over what occurred in my experience with you
I write today as Ive hit one of mybench marks Im happy to announce while clearly these can only be soft numbers that by my estimation this weekend the amount of business Ive driven away from in interest hitIt really wasnt that difficult either all I had to do was explain what my experience was and ask others as my friend to switch banks What I found that wasnt so surprising was that many had already been considering it after working with you So heres to hitting k My next target ismillion and dont worry Ill keep you in the loop and posted when it occurs

Dear Sir
I am doing business with your bank for more thanyears and during this past time I didnt have any complaint or problem with the services that you provide and how your employee provides them but I am very sorry to inform you that last week when I visited your bank for cashing some checks your desk clerk was very rude to me
When I feel that she is angry with something and not talking to me very well I politely asked her if I have done something wrong and she again rudely treated me and not only that but when I asked her to be polite she intentionally kept me waiting beside the desk while meeting with other customers 
I hope you will take notice of this misfortune and asked that lady what the original problem was and if I had offended her in some way or something else I hope you will take care of this matter and I wont have to face the same problem again or I will consider my other options including leaving the bank and closing my accounts

My name is Justin if you look at your records you will notice I used to be a customer of yours I dare say for a few years I was a very happy customer of yours That was until a few years ago when after a string of banking errors and a couple of mistakes on my part forced me to discontinue our previously wellestablished relationship
This was due to a number of factors but primarily the unwillingness of your company to correct what were bank errors due to one of your managers notes I opened my account with you when I waswhen I wasI had two overdraft charges that were reversed they were mistakes on my part One of your managers though put a note on my account stating that no more overdraft charges were to be reversed This became an issue when a number of years later a banking error causedoverdraft charges to occur on a single day I appealed as high as the regional manager but was told nothing could be done The total overdrawn was less thanbut resulted inin overdraft charges I refused to pay and for good reason as my deposit slip clearly showed which account my deposit was supposed to go in ie the account it DID NOT go into and was subsequently overdrawn I wonder now if youll see this as big of a mistake as I did at the time
The result of this banking error was my name being sent to collections and after all was settled it cost me aroundThat was my cost It brings me great personal satisfaction to write this letter to you and announce what I estimate the current cost of your practices has been to you thus far It has been my goal over the last few years to ensure that all persons in my social network are aware of just how awful you treat your customers Im happy to announce that since this occurrence Ive successfully persuadedpeople to leave bankothers to refinance home mortgages with other institutions and preventedpeople from either switching to your bank or opening an account with you simply by truthfully going over what occurred in my experience with you
I write today as Ive hit one of mybench marks Im happy to announce while clearly these can only be soft numbers that by my estimation this weekend the amount of business Ive driven away from in interest hitIt really wasnt that difficult either all I had to do was explain what my experience was and ask others as my friend to switch banks What I found that wasnt so surprising was that many had already been considering it after working with you So heres to hitting k My next target ismillion and dont worry Ill keep you in the loop and posted when it occurs

I recently applied for a loan with the abovereferenced bank and was denied credit because give the reason why the bank told you your application was denied I have attached a copy of the written notification the bank gave me for denying my credit application


I believe that the true reason this bank denied me credit was based on my sex or race or marital status and that this bank has violated my rights under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act I believe this to be the case for the following reasons


 My income is sufficient to qualify for the loan

 My debttoincome ratio is within an acceptable range

 I have excellent credit My credit score is 

 The loan officer asked me several inappropriate questions about how many children I plan to have and if I plan to get married soon

My name is Justin if you look at your records you will notice I used to be a customer of yours I dare say for a few years I was a very happy customer of yours That was until a few years ago when after a string of banking errors and a couple of mistakes on my part forced me to discontinue our previously wellestablished relationship
This was due to a number of factors but primarily the unwillingness of your company to correct what were bank errors due to one of your managers notes I opened my account with you when I waswhen I wasI had two overdraft charges that were reversed they were mistakes on my part One of your managers though put a note on my account stating that no more overdraft charges were to be reversed This became an issue when a number of years later a banking error causedoverdraft charges to occur on a single day I appealed as high as the regional manager but was told nothing could be done The total overdrawn was less thanbut resulted inin overdraft charges I refused to pay and for good reason as my deposit slip clearly showed which account my deposit was supposed to go in ie the account it DID NOT go into and was subsequently overdrawn I wonder now if youll see this as big of a mistake as I did at the time
The result of this banking error was my name being sent to collections and after all was settled it cost me aroundThat was my cost It brings me great personal satisfaction to write this letter to you and announce what I estimate the current cost of your practices has been to you thus far It has been my goal over the last few years to ensure that all persons in my social network are aware of just how awful you treat your customers Im happy to announce that since this occurrence Ive successfully persuadedpeople to leave bankothers to refinance home mortgages with other institutions and preventedpeople from either switching to your bank or opening an account with you simply by truthfully going over what occurred in my experience with you
I write today as Ive hit one of mybench marks Im happy to announce while clearly these can only be soft numbers that by my estimation this weekend the amount of business Ive driven away from in interest hitIt really wasnt that difficult either all I had to do was explain what my experience was and ask others as my friend to switch banks What I found that wasnt so surprising was that many had already been considering it after working with you So heres to hitting k My next target ismillion and dont worry Ill keep you in the loop and posted when it occurs

This was due to a number of factors but primarily the unwillingness of your company to correct what were bank errors due to one of your managers notes I opened my account with you when I waswhen I wasI had two overdraft charges that were reversed they were mistakes on my part One of your managers though put a note on my account stating that no more overdraft charges were to be reversed This became an issue when a number of years later a banking error causedoverdraft charges to occur on a single day I appealed as high as the regional manager but was told nothing could be done The total overdrawn was less thanbut resulted inin overdraft charges I refused to pay and for good reason as my deposit slip clearly showed which account my deposit was supposed to go in ie the account it DID NOT go into and was subsequently overdrawn I wonder now if youll see this as big of a mistake as I did at the time
The result of this banking error was my name being sent to collections and after all was settled it cost me aroundThat was my cost It brings me great personal satisfaction to write this letter to you and announce what I estimate the current cost of your practices has been to you thus far It has been my goal over the last few years to ensure that all persons in my social network are aware of just how awful you treat your customers Im happy to announce that since this occurrence Ive successfully persuadedpeople to leave bankothers to refinance home mortgages with other institutions and preventedpeople from either switching to your bank or opening an account with you simply by truthfully going over what occurred in my experience with you
I write today as Ive hit one of mybench marks Im happy to announce while clearly these can only be soft numbers that by my estimation this weekend the amount of business Ive driven away from in interest hitIt really wasnt that difficult either all I had to do was explain what my experience was and ask others as my friend to switch banks What I found that wasnt so surprising was that many had already been considering it after working with you So heres to hitting k My next target ismillion and dont worry Ill keep you in the loop and posted when it occurs
While I certainly have enjoyed writing you to make you aware of whats going on I also thought maybe this could give you a little insight on the true cost of screwing loyal customers over Have a nice day Ill be in touch

When I feel that she is angry with something and not talking to me very well I politely asked her if I have done something wrong and she again rudely treated me and not only that but when I asked her to be polite she intentionally kept me waiting beside the desk while meeting with other customers 
I hope you will take notice of this misfortune and asked that lady what the original problem was and if I had offended her in some way or something else I hope you will take care of this matter and I wont have to face the same problem again or I will consider my other options including leaving the bank and closing my accounts

"Subject complaint letter about the rude behaviour of staff
Dear Sir
I am doing business with your bank for more thanyears and during this past time I didnt have any complaint or problem with the services that you provide and how your employee provides them but I am very sorry to inform you that last week when I visited your bank for cashing some checks your desk clerk was very rude to me
When I feel that she is angry with something and not talking to me very well I politely asked her if I have done something wrong and she again rudely treated me and not only that but when I asked her to be polite she intentionally kept me waiting beside the desk while meeting with other customers 
I hope you will take notice of this misfortune and asked that lady what the original problem was and if I had offended her in some way or something else I hope you will take care of this matter and I wont have to face the same problem again or I will consider my other options including leaving the bank and closing my accounts

I recently applied for a loan with the abovereferenced bank and was denied credit because give the reason why the bank told you your application was denied I have attached a copy of the written notification the bank gave me for denying my credit application


I believe that the true reason this bank denied me credit was based on my sex or race or marital status and that this bank has violated my rights under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act I believe this to be the case for the following reasons


 My income is sufficient to qualify for the loan

"Subject complaint letter about the rude behaviour of staff
Dear Sir
I am doing business with your bank for more thanyears and during this past time I didnt have any complaint or problem with the services that you provide and how your employee provides them but I am very sorry to inform you that last week when I visited your bank for cashing some checks your desk clerk was very rude to me
When I feel that she is angry with something and not talking to me very well I politely asked her if I have done something wrong and she again rudely treated me and not only that but when I asked her to be polite she intentionally kept me waiting beside the desk while meeting with other customers 
I hope you will take notice of this misfortune and asked that lady what the original problem was and if I had offended her in some way or something else I hope you will take care of this matter and I wont have to face the same problem again or I will consider my other options including leaving the bank and closing my accounts

"To whom it may concern
My name is Justin if you look at your records you will notice I used to be a customer of yours I dare say for a few years I was a very happy customer of yours That was until a few years ago when after a string of banking errors and a couple of mistakes on my part forced me to discontinue our previously wellestablished relationship
This was due to a number of factors but primarily the unwillingness of your company to correct what were bank errors due to one of your managers notes I opened my account with you when I waswhen I wasI had two overdraft charges that were reversed they were mistakes on my part One of your managers though put a note on my account stating that no more overdraft charges were to be reversed This became an issue when a number of years later a banking error causedoverdraft charges to occur on a single day I appealed as high as the regional manager but was told nothing could be done The total overdrawn was less thanbut resulted inin overdraft charges I refused to pay and for good reason as my deposit slip clearly showed which account my deposit was supposed to go in ie the account it DID NOT go into and was subsequently overdrawn I wonder now if youll see this as big of a mistake as I did at the time
The result of this banking error was my name being sent to collections and after all was settled it cost me aroundThat was my cost It brings me great personal satisfaction to write this letter to you and announce what I estimate the current cost of your practices has been to you thus far It has been my goal over the last few years to ensure that all persons in my social network are aware of just how awful you treat your customers Im happy to announce that since this occurrence Ive successfully persuadedpeople to leave bankothers to refinance home mortgages with other institutions and preventedpeople from either switching to your bank or opening an account with you simply by truthfully going over what occurred in my experience with you
I write today as Ive hit one of mybench marks Im happy to announce while clearly these can only be soft numbers that by my estimation this weekend the amount of business Ive driven away from in interest hitIt really wasnt that difficult either all I had to do was explain what my experience was and ask others as my friend to switch banks What I found that wasnt so surprising was that many had already been considering it after working with you So heres to hitting k My next target ismillion and dont worry Ill keep you in the loop and posted when it occurs
While I certainly have enjoyed writing you to make you aware of whats going on I also thought maybe this could give you a little insight on the true cost of screwing loyal customers over Have a nice day Ill be in touch
